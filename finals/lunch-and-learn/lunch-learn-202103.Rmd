# 1. Insurance choice is confusing

  - "More than half of all uninsured (56%) say they are likely to go to the marketplace to find a health plan in the future. But there are knowledge gaps."
  - "Six in 10 are confused about or have not heard of the tax credit, and more than 7 in 10 want one-on-one help understanding their insurance options"

# This paper

Lots of people participating in a very complicated decision. With this in mind, we ask the following questions:

1. Does some form of decision assistance "help" in plan selection?
2. Does the type of assistance matter (private versus public)?
3. Do insurers use brokers/agents to steer people to different plans?
4. What are the welfare effects of any such steering?

# What are the exchanges?

- Online marketplace to purchase private health insurance for those without insurance through their employers or other public programs

- Intended to help fill the "coverage gap" for the 40+ million uninsured individuals in the U.S. (pre ACA)

- Complicated program with various premium and cost-sharing subsidies, specific to a household
