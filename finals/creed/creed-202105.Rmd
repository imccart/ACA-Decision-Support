# This paper

Lots of people participating in a very complicated decision. With this in mind, we ask the following questions:

1. Does some form of decision assistance "help" in plan selection?

2. Do insurers use brokers/agents to steer people to different plans?

3. What are the welfare effects of any such steering?

# What's new?

- Large literature on choice inconsistencies
  - Abaluck and Gruber, *AER*, 2011
  - Ketcham et al., *AER*, 2012
  - Gruber, *JEP*, 2017

- What's new here?
  - Role of decision assistance in health
  - Commissions and steering

# Sources

Main enrollment come from Covered California under FOIA. This includes:
- Individual demographics and income
- Plan purchases
- Information on type of assistance (if any)
- 8.3 million households, 4.5 million new enrollees

Supplemental data include:
- ACS and SIPP for predicting uninsured
- ACA program data (contribution percentages, rating areas, etc.)

# What is a dominated choice?

In our context...

- Subsidies available for households with incomes below 250% of the FPL
- At 150% of the FPL, larger subsidies are such that actuarial value of silver plans exceeds that of gold and platinum plans
- Gold and platinum plans dominated by silver plans for incomes $\leq$ 150% FPL
- Gold plans dominated by silver plans for incomes between 150% and 200% FPL

--

About 3.2% of households make a dominated choice in our data

---
# Estimation and identification

- Linear probability model of dominated choices or switching
- Dummy variable for receiving any assistance
- Selection on observables assumption (for now)

# Estimand of interest

- Want to identify the Average Treatment Effect on the Treated (ATT) of decision assistance

- Denote by $Pr[Y_{ij}^{1}]$ the probability of household $i$ selecting plan $j$ with decision assistance

- Denote by $Pr[Y_{ij}^{0}]$ the probability of household $i$ selecting plan $j$ without decision assistance

--

$$ATT = Pr[Y_{ij}^{1} | \text{Assist}] - Pr[Y_{ij}^{0} | \text{Assist}]$$


---
# Estimation

1. Estimate multinomial logit model among those without any decision assistance, $\hat{\theta}$

2. Use $\hat{\theta}$ to form predicted counterfactual, $\widehat{Pr[Y_{ij}^{0} | \text{Assist}]}$

3. Use predicted value in ATT estimate: $$\underbrace{Pr[Y_{ij}^{1} | \text{Assist}]}_{Observed} - \underbrace{\widehat{Pr[Y_{ij}^{0} | \text{Assist}]}}_{Predicted}$$

4. Aggregate to level of insurer and metal

# Estimation

- Focus only on new enrollees to avoid presence of inertia

- Estimate separately by year and rating area



---
# Inference

- Clustered bootstrap, by year and rating area

- 200 bootstrap replications

- Confidence interval based on the 5th and 95th percentile of bootstrap replications

# Quantifying steering effect

**Calculate commission elasticities of demand**

1. Estimate nested logit choice model with commission as covariate
2. Compute commission elasticity (percent change in demand for a 1% increase in commission)
